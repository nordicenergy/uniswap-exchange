#### Nordic EnergyÂ´s Uniswap a protocol for automated token exchange on Ethereum (ERC-20) and Nordic Energy consensus tokens.

The Nordic Energy redesigned Uniswap open source protocol provides an interface for seamless exchange of Nordic Energy and Ethereum tokens. By eliminating unnecessary forms of rent extraction and middlemen it allows faster, more efficient exchange. Where it makes tradeoffs, decentralization, censorship resistance, and security are prioritized. Uniswap is forked Uniswap open source and functions as a public good. There is no central token or platform fee. No special treatment is given to early investors, adopters, or developers. Token listing is open and free. All smart contract functions are public and all upgrades are opt-in.

#### This site will serve as a project overview for Uniswap - explaining how it works, how to use it, and how to build on top of it. These docs are actively being worked on and more information will be added on an ongoing basis.

Run Uniswap Locally

Download and unzip the build.zip file from the latest release in the Releases tab.

Serve the build/ folder locally, and access the application via a browser.

For more information on running a local server see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server. This simple approach has one downside: refreshing the page will give a 404 because of how React handles client-side routing. To fix this issue, consider running serve -s courtesy of the serve package.

#### Develop Uniswap Locally

Install Dependencies

yarn
Configure Environment

Rename .env.local.example to .env.local and fill in the appropriate variables.

Run

yarn start
To run on a testnet, make a copy of .env.local.example named .env.local, change REACT_APP_NETWORK_ID to "{yourNetworkId}", and change REACT_APP_NETWORK_URL to e.g. "https://{yourNetwork}.infura.io/v3/{yourKey}".

If deploying with Github Pages, be aware that there's some tricky client-side routing behavior with create-react-app.

#### Contributions

Please open all pull requests against the beta branch. CI checks will run against all PRs. To ensure that your changes will pass, run yarn check:all before pushing. If this command fails, you can try to automatically fix problems with yarn fix:all, or do it manually.
